DEPTHS

you are falling down a hole. you need to dodge shit. can fall faster (which makes it harder, but you finish faster)

^ that + dustforce kinda shit? idk

^ mouse-only game?


you drop a ball down a hole and it breaks some walls that are blocking you until it runs out of juice. you get money by breaking stuff.
you spend the money to buy upgrades ot make the ball have more juice.
eventually you reach the bottom after breaking many things and you win
